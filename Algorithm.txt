I. Start The Game
	
   1. Taking variable name ask for the name of the user and store it in the variable name.

   2. Make a function that will randomly shuffle all the movies name present in the list movieName.
   	  movieName list should look like this -
   	               movieName = ['Zindagi/Na/Milegi/Dobara', ----- ]  ; all the spaces are represent through slash.

   3. There will a total of 3 chances to play the game and a total of 9 chances(number of character in Bollywood) to guess the given movie. So 	
      make a variable totChance and assign it the value 3 and totGuess and assign it the value 9.

   4. Then pick up the first word from the list and display all the vowels and all the other consonents and numbers are displayed by dashes.

   5. Make a variable guess and the user will enter his/her guess character in there, if the guess character is true then it will be displayed 	
      in the displayed word otherwise totGuess will be decremented by one; and two more variable success and failure assign them a zero as well.

   6. If the totGuess becomes zero then the chance to guess the word is over and your totChance will be decremented by one.

   7. If one guesses three consecutive movie name given correctly then totChance will be incremented by one.

   8. For correctly gussing a movie name 5 points will be given, i.e. points will be increment by 5 and success will be incremented by 1; and 
      for the wrong guess 2 points will be taken; i.e. failure will be incremented by one.

   9. On displaying the movie name at the last remove all the dashes and replace it by spaces; i.e.
   					Zindagi/Na/Milegi/Dobara will become Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara

   10. When the totChance becomes zero the game ends and all the stats will be dispalyed on the screen, these stats includes - name, total  
       score, number of successful attempts, number of unsuccessful attempts.
